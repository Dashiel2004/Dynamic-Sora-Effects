# Dynamic-Sora-Effects

Based off a request I saw by -felix- and the amazing Dynamic Shulk Effects mod done by the wonderful LilyLambda, Im made a mod that accomplishes a similar goal for Sora, this mod will change Sora's trail effects based off which Spell he Currently has queued up.
The Dynamic Sora effects folder can be extracted to you mods folder, you don't have to move the NRO anywhere else, just leave it where it is

You can find the Game Banana page for it here: https://gamebanana.com/mods/531437
